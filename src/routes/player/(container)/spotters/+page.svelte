<h1>Spotters</h1>
<p>
  Spotters DO NOT make rulings. They can however guide the group but their call does NOT supersede
  the ruling of the group. Do remember that the spotters are volunteers helping out to give you the
  best possible experience participating in the Copenhagen Open 2024 and a “Thank you” or a high
  five goes a long way.
