<h1>Accomodation</h1>
<p>
  Copenhagen boasts a little shy of 25,000 hotel rooms from five-star luxury to hostels. On top of
  that there are plenty of Airbnb's and couches to surf. In other words, it will be no problem to
  find a place to crash.

  In close proximity of the course at Valbyparken you'll find the cheap hostel “a&o Copenhagen
  Sydhavn” and the pricier “Scandic Sydhavn”, “Scandic Sluseholmen” and “Moxy Sydhavnen”. They're
  all a mere 5-minute bike ride from Tee 1. A little further away (15 minutes on bike) you can book
  cheap rooms at “Cabinn Copenhagen” and “Wakeup Copenhagen”.
